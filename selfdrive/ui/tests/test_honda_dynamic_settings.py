The Honda dynamic longitudinal learning settings live in three places that have
to agree: the Params registry (C++), the settings panels (Python/raylib), and
the tuner itself (opendbc, a submodule). The panels deliberately hardcode the
key names and defaults instead of importing the tuner, so that a broken tuner
can never take the settings screen off the screen -- this test is what keeps
that copy honest.

Source is parsed, never imported: the panels pull in raylib, which is not
available in every test environment.
